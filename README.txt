Installation Instructions:

On a Windows machine, run 'build.bat'
On the UVic Windows lab computers, run 'build_winlab.bat'
On a Unix-based machine (including Mac OS X), run 'make' instead.

Due to the LPSolver used, this program does not work on 64bit Java versions. Any computer with Java Version > 1.7 x86 should be able to compile it. A Jar file is included in case compilation with the pre-made files does not work out on your machine.

*Note: the build and make files already compile and run the program with input parameter of 55 players. Feel free to change this number.
